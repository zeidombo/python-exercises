# Python Projects for Beginners

Welcome to my collection of Python projects for beginners! This repository contains a set of simple Python projects that are perfect for those who are just starting out with programming in Python.

Each project is designed to be simple enough for a beginner to complete on their own, but still interesting enough to keep them engaged and motivated. They cover a range of topics, from basic data manipulation to web scraping and beyond.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git`


Replace "yourusername" and "your-repo-name" with your own GitHub username and the name of your forked repository.

## Projects

The exercises for each project are included in the `python-projects.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook covering a range of topics.


Each project has its own section in the Jupyter Notebook, with detailed instructions and example code to help you get started. The exercises are designed to be completed in order, as each project builds on the skills and concepts covered in the previous ones.
